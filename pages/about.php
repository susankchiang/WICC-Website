          <h1>Mission</h1>
          <p>Our goal is to bring together the women in computing at Cornell. We seek to expand the opportunities and successes of women in CS. We hope to encourage prospective computer science majors, and provide direction and assistance to current computer science students. We seek to create a network for women undergraduates, faculty, and staff, and promote interaction on academic, social and professional issues. We plan on hosting activities to educate women about the opportunities in the computing field and connecting students with women leaders in the field. We hope to broaden the computing community and extend the “conversation” about why it’s important to increase the number of women in computing.</p>

        <h1>Description</h1>
          <p>Our plans for this year are focused on the three areas: building a community, networking and expanding knowledge as well as opportunities, and outreach to young girls. We are working with the CS department to give out scholarships to allow young women at Cornell to attend the Grace Hopper Conference (the largest celebration of Women in Computing). We are working with companies to host panels and inspiring alumni talks targeted toward women in the computing industry. We plan to collaborate with organizations like SWE and Women in Engineering Weekend Planning to host Computer Science related events with them during their outreach activities. In addition, through reaching out to Ithaca high school and making videos, we want to dispel some of the myths surrounding women in computer science. We also plan to hold social meet and greet events to help networking between women in Computer Science and CS faculty.</p>
