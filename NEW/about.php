          <p>WICC was founded in March 2013 to bring together women in computing fields at Cornell, 
            expand their opportunities and successes, provide a support network of women, and empower 
            them to encourage younger women to consider computing fields. We hope to create a budding 
            community for women and promote interaction on academic, social, and professional issues. 
            By making women in computing fields visible, providing role models and dispelling stereotypes, 
            WICC fosters a support network to empower women and encourage young girls to discover 
            their love for computing.</p>
