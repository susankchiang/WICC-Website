        <p class="large">WICC was founded in March 2013 to bring together women in computing fields at Cornell, expand their opportunities and successes, provide a support network of women, and empower them to encourage younger women to consider computing fields. We hope to create a budding community for women and promote interaction on academic, social, and professional issues. By making women in computing fields visible, providing role models and dispelling stereotypes, WICC fosters a support network to empower women and encourage young girls to discover their love for computing.</p>

            <p>I came to college with a love for math and science but I never even considered computer science. I was intimidated by the stereotypes surrounding the field and the lack of women in it, but what turned my life around were women technologists and mentors. I took my first CS class and now I can’t imagine if there’s anything else I would have been passionate about in life if I hadn't decided to study CS. WICC seeks to ensure other women don't miss finding their passions in life by providing the encouragement, inspiration, and community to confidently pursue computing fields.</p>

            <p>I have always been drawn to problem solving and making things work. Perhaps I should have always known I was going to do computer science, but I kept on denying it to myself. My second semester freshman year, however, I took my first programming class at Cornell and could not ignore how much I enjoyed it. Since then, I have not been able to imagine pursuing another major. I got involved with WICC because of my indecision as an underclassmen; I refused to consider CS for so many reasons both practical and unreasonable that I wish I had more guidance and mentorship. WICC in particular spoke out to me because it has been so beneficial to network of female peers who have similar experience as I. An interesting fact about myself: I love coconut milk a lot… </p>

            <p>Growing up in the Bay Area, I had grown up with an interest in Computer Science, but I took my first proper coding class when I entered Cornell. Ever since then, I became hooked onto how fun the classes were and how many areas of life CS seems to touch. Seriously, it seems like everything required programming these days! Another thing that drew me were the people. Never in my life have I met such entrepreneurial, creative, and intelligent people! I love CS and the caring community that WICC fosters.</p>

            <p>I didn't know a thing about computer science until I first developed my own cooking website to share my recipes with friends and family from around the world. It amazed me to see how typing in a different language could allow me to create websites, applications, games...the list goes on! Computer science has provided me with the opportunity to blend my passions with technology, and create an impact in the world. WICC has motivated and inspired me, and has given me a wonderful community of amazing female technologists who are willing to bring a change.</p>

            <p>My dad encouraged me to study Computer Science early on. I started programming in my first year of high school, and soon after, I began research in CS with his assistance. I really enjoy what I can do with CS, and there are so many opportunities out there. I never considered studying anything else; I knew I would choose something under the engineering field since I have always loved math as well. Also, studying CS is a great way to gain not only tehnical skills but also great problem-solving skills that can be applied anywhere. An interesting fact about myself is that I was born in China and moved to the U.S. when I was 1 year old. :)</p>

            <p>Computer science is such a unique field where you can truly apply anything you learn in the classroom to any other area you can think of.  I have always loved math and science, and the idea that I can use these things to make a difference in the world is so exciting to me.  I think it's really important to encourage more people, both men and women, to pursue computer science by making the community more accepting and breaking many of the stereotypes associated with this field. Some interesting facts about myself: I speak Hungarian, love Thai food, and used to play the oboe!</p>

            <p>I came to college undecided, but after my first few classes I decided on CS. Functional programming (first semester sophomore year) really got me hooked and convinced me that I made the right choice! I like CS because it ranges from low-level up to web develop up to algorithm design -- it embodies so many different applications, but all with the same foundation of thinking hard and solving problems. Fun is a keyword.</p>
